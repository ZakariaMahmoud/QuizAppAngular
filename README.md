# Quiz App Angular 

**My project idea is a website to test the strength of friendship between you and your friends.**

**To build this project, I used :**

- **Angular 11**
- **Firebase RealTime Database** 
- **Bootstrap**
- **ngx-spinner**

**😀 Try the website : [www.quiz2022.com](https://quiz2022.com/)**

## Explain the idea
 - On the main page, you can choose the test that suits you (many tests will be added in the coming days)

 - After you choose a test, the App asks you to enter your full name.

 - After clicking "Start the test", the test begins. The App asks you to answer 10 questions.

 - After that, the site automatically generates your own link that you can share with your friends.

 - After your friend clicks on the link, the App asks him to enter his full name.

 - After that, the App will ask it to answer your same questions. If the choice of your friend and yours is identical, the background of the button will be colored green, and if it does not match, the background of the button will be colored in red.

 - In the end, you show your friend the result of his compatibility with you. With a table with results for your friends
